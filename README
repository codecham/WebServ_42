For testing just do a make and try with:

1: "curl localhost 4242" --> do a basic GET method

2: "curl -X POST -d "Hello from curl!" http://localhost:4242" --> do a basic POST method

3: localhost:4242 is a web browser for see a HTTP request created from browser

You can configure the config file as you want!

- If you configure a server on host 127.0.0.1 only you can send request

- If you configure a server on host 0.0.0.0 all connexion from other computer can be accepted

Sometimes, sockets can take a lot of time to close, so the program can insult you with an error because it fails to create a socket! When it's happends just change the port in config file !
